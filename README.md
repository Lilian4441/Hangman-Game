# HangmanGame:standing_person:
<h3> An text-based hangman game that runs in the terminal. </h3>
<h4> Completed: July 2023 </h4>

This personal project involved implementing various classes and objects to develop the game's core mechanics: allowing players to guess words and phrases within the constraints of the classic hangman challenge. Although there were no graphical elements involved, I gained valuable insights into Java programming, enhancing my understanding of object-oriented concepts and sharpening my problem-solving skills.
